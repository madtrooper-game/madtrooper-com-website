    answer: (
      <>
        <p>
          The rarity of the Mad Troopers is based on the category under which
          your Mad Trooper falls. The categories are clearly defined on{" "}
          <a
            href="https://madtrooper.com/"

            https://madtrooper.com
          </a>{" "}
          , the standing in terms of rarity is Legendary Masters {">"}{" "}
          Commanders {">"}
          Sergeants {">"} Troopers . The troopers hold the classic colt and the
          diamond axe, the sergeants hold the trooper revolver and the diamond
          axe, the commanders hold the galactic gun and the disc of death while
          the legendary masters hold the galactic gun and the laser spear. Apart
          from this, Golden accessories or golden weapons further increase the
          rarity of the trooper! Attributes can easily be viewed on your Solana
          wallets.{" "}
